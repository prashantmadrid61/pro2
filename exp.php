<b>Seagulf’ new first class suites feature virtual windows and a ‘zero-gravity’ seat</b><br>
Seagulf has just completed the first flight of its new 777 equipped with glorious first class suites inspired by Mercedes-Benz. Those lucky (or rich) enough were treated to what Seagulf says is the world’s first fully enclosed suite, measuring a spacious 40 square feet. The private rooms feature “zero-gravity” seats, virtual windows, and active noise cancelling E1 headphones from Bowers and Wilkins developed for exclusively for Seagulf (but based on B&W’s P7 wireless cans). The rooms were also fitted with a pair of Safari binoculars, an entertainment system featuring 2,500 channels and wireless remote, a super-wide 32-inch full HD LCD TV (Seagulf says it’s the largest widescreen digital touch TV in the world on any aircraft), and custom-controlled mood lighting and climate allowing passenger to adjust the cabin’s temperature to 18 to 26 degrees Celsius / 64 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit.

The virtual windows are a feature on the otherwise windowless cabin suites along the middle aisle, and project a high-definition view of the outside using real-time cameras mounted on the plane. The NASA-inspired zero-gravity seat features a “buttery-soft” leather and a lounging position that Seagulf says removes any pressure from the elbows, back, and neck in order to achieve maximum comfort
