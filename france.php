        <h2>Flights to France</h2>
Few destinations in the world have been romanticised quite as much as this one. Flights to France can be the start of a whirlwind getaway. 

The capital, Paris, has so much to offer – the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe and Montmartre – to name just a few attractions. And that’s without mentioning its world-renowned art galleries, which include the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Musée d’Orsay and, of course, the Louvre – where you can view Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and see the world’s most famous smile in person. 

Paris is also home to some incredible hotels, restaurants and lounges, many of which are made even more appealing by the legends that go with them. These range from the Ritz, where Coco Chanel stayed in the 1940s, to L’Auberge de Venise, a restaurant that was once the Dingo Bar, a venue frequented by Ernest Hemingway and F Scott Fitzgerald. 

While the dining is phenomenal in Paris, those in the know would argue that it’s Lyon, the country’s third largest city, which is the true food capital of the country. This is the place to linger around in charming, casual bistros over authentic dishes made with local ingredients. 

Nice, France’s second most visited city, combines perennially gorgeous weather, legendary beaches and a glamour-infused history. Traverse the Promenade des Anglais or the historic old town to immerse yourself in this picture-perfect destination. 

Of course, if you’d rather escape the hustle and bustle of city life, France is also home to some glorious countryside, like the iconic rolling hills and fields of Provence. Alternatively, head for the coast – the French Riviera (Côte d’Azur) more than lives up to its reputation for beautiful scenery (and people).</p><br>
